# Field-2D

* Add a counter and increase  Field.value only 
  if counter reached the target-frequency-value.

# Move-Field-2D

* Field with a direction and a speed.
** Add a Move-Field and move (a single Field as a Part) 
   every time, the Move-Field finished one cycle. 

# Probability-Move-Field-2D

* Add a Probability and Move the probabilities of fields.
* Distribute the probability of a field to the next fields.
* All possible states are stored in a array with its probability.
  The probability is moved frome one state to the next state.
